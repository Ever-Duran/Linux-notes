The ls command shows a list of archive information.

Most commands follow a similar syntax pattern:
command [optiones…] [arguments…]

e.g. as we enter the command ls without any options or argument, it returns by default a list of archives
contained in the same current directory.

**An argument is used to specify something about the command to run.

e.g. ls Documents
As a result, it shows a list of the archives included into the Documents directory.

Given the fact that Linux is opensource, some developers have added their own commands.
e.g. aptitude, which accepts moo as an argument.

sysadmin@localhost:~$ aptitude moo  
There are no Easter Eggs in this program.

**Options can be used to modify the behaviour of a command.
In the previous example, ls shows the list of archive information, but if we added -l it would show a long screen result and 
provide more info about the listed archives.

By default, the command ls prints the values alphabetically, by adding option -r it will print the results alphabetically sorted by in the opposite way.

More than one options can be used separately or combined. 
All these ones will have the same effect:
ls -l -r
ls -rl
ls -lr
